<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Understanding customer sentiment and behavior is crucial for improving sales strategies. By leveraging advanced AI and ML technologies, we aimed to create a tool that not only transcribes calls but also provides actionable insights to help sales teams better understand and engage with their customers.

### Built With
* Whisper: For natural language processing (NLP) to transcribe audio recordings.
* NLTK: For analyzing sentiment.
* Transformer models: For summarizing transcriptions
* HTML/CSS: For the front-end development.
* Flask: For the back-end development.
* AOS: For animations.
* Chart.js: For visualizing sentiment trends with interactive charts and graphs.

Throughout the development of Vocal Insights, we learned the importance of balancing accuracy and performance in AI models. We gained valuable experience in integrating multiple technologies to create a cohesive solution. This project also highlighted the potential of AI in transforming sales strategies by providing deeper insights into customer behavior.

Looking ahead, we plan to enhance Vocal Insights by incorporating real-time sentiment analysis during live calls. We aim to refine our models further to improve accuracy and handle a wider range of accents and languages. Additionally, we plan to add more advanced analytics features, such as predictive analytics to forecast customer behavior based on sentiment trends. Expanding the application to integrate with popular CRM systems will also be a key focus, making it easier for sales teams to incorporate Vocal Insights into their existing workflows.
