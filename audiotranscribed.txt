I'm tired of being what you want me to be. Don't know what you're expecting of me But under the pressure of walking in your shoes Every step that I take is another mistake to you I've become so numb, I can't feel you there Ryan. I'm becoming this All I want to do Is be more like me And be less like you Can't you see that you're smothering me? Holding too tightly Afraid to lose control Cause everything that you thought I would be Has fallen apart Right in front of you. Every step that I take is another mistake to you I'm caught in the undertow, I'm just caught in the undertow And every second I waste is more than I can take I've become so numb, I can't feel you there I've become so tired, so much more nowhere I'm becoming this, all I want to do. And be less like you And I know I may end up Failing too But I know You were just like me With someone disappointed in you I've become so numb I can't feel you there Become so tired. I'm becoming this, all I want to do is be more like me and be left like you I've become so numb, I can't feel you let out, being what you want me to be I've become so numb, I can't feel you let out, being what you want me to be. Thanks for watching!.
